              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                The Bardify App processes the lyrics of a users’ choosing through
                a Shakespearean translator and brings them back to the user via
                text and text to speech.
              </p>
              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>
                The list of entertainment apps is long, but my team didn’t find 
                anything that would introduce young people to classic literature and 
                Early Modern English that would, at the same time, relate to their interests.
              </p>
              <h2>Users & Audience</h2>
              <p>
                After we completed our research, we distinguished two main groups of users and 
                asked a few questions to get more information about their habits, motivation, interests, 
                and goals when it comes to hobbies, entertainment, consuming online resources, and spare time.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    The youth population that enjoys music and prefers watching movies 
                    and listening to audiobooks, over reading printed books.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Literature enthusiasts who like reading books, listening to
                  audiobooks, and watching movie adaptation of books (in
                  this particular order).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Name & Logo</h2>
              <p>
                I came up with the name Bardify by combining the word “Bard” (William Shakespeare’s nickname) 
                and a suffix “ify” (meaning “to become, be made”). <br><br>
                The Bardify Logo was inspired by William Shakespeare's portrait.
                I wanted to create a trademark that could capture the literature
                icon, but also combine it with a modern lifestyle. The
                headphones represent music, and simple design gives a contemporary
                look.
              </p>
              <h2>Type & Color</h2>
              <p>Cinzel is a typeface that reflects the 16th century and also merges in a contemporary feel.</br>
                Raleway is an elegant, readable sans-serif typeface family that goes well with the Cinzel typeface.
                <br/>
                When it came to the color palette for the app, we researched some of the popular colors that the 16th Century Renaissance painters had used. The tone palette includes eight basic colors: Green Earth, Yellow Ocher, Red Ocher, Raw Umber, Burnt Umber, Burnt Sienna, Vine Black, and Lead White.
                We decided on a gradient that includes the different shades of Ocher and Burnt Sienna.</p>

                    </ol>	
                    <h3>Layout</h3>
                    <p>Simplicity in design was the main focus of the app. To distill a design down to its simplest form, I design with the mobile-first approach. 
                        This strategy helps me consider what's most important in a product. The sleek and intuitive design gives the user clear options.
